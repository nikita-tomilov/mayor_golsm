The article describes the concept of an LSM tree-based storage for buffering time series data on an edge device within the Golang application. The comparative analysis was performed to a traditional in-application data storage engine SQLite. The developed library provides faster data reads and data writes than SQLite as long as the timestamps in the time series data are linearly increasing, which is common for any data logging application.
